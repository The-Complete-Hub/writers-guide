<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article, we will learn what Design tools and frameworks are, types, usefullness, and more...<br>Design Thinking, Design Sprints &amp; Agile are often force-fit as solutions to Innovation or Product Design challenges with no thought as to why. When looking into each framework they aren't always clear on the best use-case for each and leave many aspects open to interpretation.</p>

<h2>Definition of Design Tools, Design Frameowrks</h2>
<p>Design tools provide users with the ability to create and manipulate images, logos, written texts, and other elements that are used in the creation of visual designs. These tools are often used by designers, architects, and other professionals who create visual designs. Design tools can be software programs that are used on a computer or touchscreen device, or they can be physical tools that are used to draw or sketch images. Design frameworks are used by designers or creative teams to guide their creative process or solve specific design problems. They are used to guide the decision making process and keep the team focused on the goal. They do not provide the specific solutions for a problem but rather guide the team in the right direction and help them avoid common design traps or mistakes.</p>
<h2>Types of Design Tools and Frameworks</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Design Patterns - allow designers to identify common design issues and solutions to those issues. They serve as a guide for designers to avoid common mistakes and follow a standard process for design. There are many design pattern libraries available, such as the U.S. Department of Design Pattern Library and the Design Pattern Library.</li>
    <li> Principles - are broad statements that guide designers in their work. Design principles are used to make decisions about design, as well as to evaluate designs. There are many design principles that are followed by designers, including harmony, balance, and contrast.</li>
    <li> Theories - are explanations of how design works. They give designers an understanding of design and how it can be applied to solve problems. There are many design theories that are used by designers. Some of the most common design theories include Gestalt theory, Symbolic Interactionism, and Semiotics.</li>
    <li> Design Tools - are used to create or manipulate images, logos, written texts, and other elements that are used in the creation of visual designs. These tools can be software programs or physical tools that are used to draw or sketch images.</li>
    <li> Design Frameworks - are used by designers or creative teams to guide their creative process or solve specific design problems. They are used to guide the decision making process and keep the team focused on the goal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usefulness of Design Tools and Frameworks</h2>
<p>Design0 tools and frameworks can be useful for designers who want to follow a specific process for their work. They can help designers avoid common design mistakes and provide a structure for decision making. Design tools and frameworks can also be useful for organizations that want to train employees in design techniques or use design in their work. Design tools and frameworks are especially useful for large organizations that have design teams or employees who need guidance on design techniques or processes. Design tools and frameworks can help create a standard process and language for design that all employees, including executives, can understand.</p>
<h2>Those who uses this Design Tools and Frameworks</h2>
<p>Designers - Designers use design tools and frameworks to help them create visual images, logos, and written texts, as well as to help with other design-related tasks. Product Managers - Product managers use design tools and frameworks to guide their decision making and the development of the product. They can also use these tools to understand the needs of their target customers. Marketers - Marketers use design tools and frameworks to create visual images, logos, and written texts that can be used in marketing campaigns. They can also use these tools to understand their target customers.</p>
<h2>Exposition on Business Design</h2>
<p>Design is a crucial part of any business's function, and often goes unrecognized. A designer's job is to create an experience for customers and employees that is seamless and easy to navigate; the most famous example of this is the Apple logo. Before the Apple logo, the company used an image of an apple with a bite taken out of it that was not very memorable. The new logo, however, was very simple and easy to understand, as well as aesthetically pleasing. This made it a lot easier for customers to navigate the store and buy products, which increased the company's revenue. Design is also used to solve problems within the company, such as how to organize a workspace. The best example of this is the open office trend that is evident in many workplaces. The idea behind this is to create a space where employees can collaborate and create new ideas. However, many employees have complained that the open office trend is not conducive to work, due to distractions and interruptions. These problems have led to the implementation of design tools such as noise canceling headphones and visual blocking walls that are designed to help employees focus in the open office and create a productive work environment. This is just one example of how design is used to solve problems inside businesses.</p>
<h2>Why do you need Design Tools and Frameworks</h2>
<p>Design tools and frameworks can help ensure that designers create effective and useful designs. They can help designers focus on their work and avoid common mistakes. They can also help designers create a consistent design throughout their work or company. Design tools and frameworks can help organizations create consistent and effective design. They can also help employees understand how design is used in their work or company and create effective designs. This can help employees focus on their work and create better designs.</p>
<h2>Examples of Design Tools and Frameworks</h2>
<p>- Business Model Canvas - The Business Model Canvas is a tool that is used by business analysts to understand problems and opportunities with a company's business model. This tool can help designers understand the business model of their company and design solutions that fit the model and create value for the company. - Design Thinking - Design Thinking is a process that designers can use to solve design problems. Design Thinking encourages designers to focus on the people they are designing for and their needs. This can help designers create better and more useful designs. - Design Sprint - The Design Sprint is a process that designers can use to solve design problems. This process can help designers create quick and useful designs that can be tested with customers. This process can also be used to create effective and useful prototypes. - Human Centered Design - Human Centered Design is a process that designers can use to solve design problems. This process focuses on the people who will use the designs created by designers and their needs. This process can help designers create better and more useful designs.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Design tools and frameworks can help designers create better and more consistent designs. They can also help designers solve design problems and create effective design solutions. These tools can be especially helpful for large organizations that want to implement design in their work.</p>
