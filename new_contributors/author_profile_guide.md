We at TC Hub, are committed to showcase your work to the world, hence you are required to create a profile with us by following the given steps/guidelines: 

1. Within the authors folder, create a new folder using the intended author name as the name of the folder. 
Be sure to:
- **Use all lowercase.**
- **Use dashes in place of spaces.**
- **Do not include any special characters.**
- **Try to keep it under 40 characters.**
- **Avoid using periods (.) or commas (,) or (_ ) underscores**

2. Within that folder, upload your prepared .md file containing a short author description using the filename `index.md`. 

3. Upload any corresponding headshot image of the author using the file name `avatar`(jpg or png format). Please try to keep this image as close to 600X400 pixels (images can be resized using [Pixlr Image Editor](https://pixlr.com/e)). 

4. Add these files to the same PR (pull request).

(See *screenshot* below for file structure.)
